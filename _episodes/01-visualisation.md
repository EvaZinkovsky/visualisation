## Why visualisation?

We have spent a lot of time learning about manipulating and exploring data. What sort of information
can we learn like that?

Let's meet some datasets:


~~~
# A tibble: 1,846 x 3
   dataset     x     y
     <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
 1       4  55.4  97.2
 2       4  51.5  96.0
 3       4  46.2  94.5
 4       4  42.8  91.4
 5       4  40.8  88.3
 6       4  38.7  84.9
 7       4  35.6  79.9
 8       4  33.1  77.6
 9       4  29.0  74.5
10       4  26.2  71.4
# â€¦ with 1,836 more rows
~~~
{: .output}

Get an idea of their overall structure:


~~~
summary(data)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
    dataset         x               y           
 Min.   : 1   Min.   :15.56   Min.   : 0.01512  
 1st Qu.: 4   1st Qu.:41.07   1st Qu.:22.56107  
 Median : 7   Median :52.59   Median :47.59445  
 Mean   : 7   Mean   :54.27   Mean   :47.83510  
 3rd Qu.:10   3rd Qu.:67.28   3rd Qu.:71.81078  
 Max.   :13   Max.   :98.29   Max.   :99.69468  
~~~
{: .output}

And some summary statistics for each dataset:


~~~
data %>% 
  group_by(dataset) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_x = mean(x),
    mean_y = mean(y),
    sd_x = sd(x),
    sd_y = sd(y),
    correlation = cor(x,y)
  )
~~~
{: .language-r}

Let's try plotting one of them to see if we can spot anything new:

<img src="../fig/rmd-01-dino_scatter-1.png" title="plot of chunk dino_scatter" alt="plot of chunk dino_scatter" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

And it immediately becomes apparent what all those numbers **mean**

The other data sets we looked at are known as [the datasaurus dozen](https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/samestats). A group of 12 two-dimensional datasets that have identical:

* mean in both dimensions
* sd in both dimensions
* correlation between x and y

**But...**

## The roles of data visualisation 

In general there are two purposes behind data visualisations:

* As a discovery tool, to explore a dataset
* As a storytelling tool, to highlight features of a dataset

In both cases, a successful visualisation will illuminate and aid understanding, 
not confuse or obscure.

## Talking about visualisations

Our goal today will be to learn how to **describe** visualisations and their connections to data.
We will build up a consistent vocabulary around visualisations that can be used to describe and create
any visualisation you can imagine.

The big concept of the day is any plot can be constructed by mapping variables in your **data** to 
visual properties (**aesthetics**) which are then applied to the physical marks (**geometries**) chosen
to represent the data

This will probably be a very big change in how you think about figures, let's try it.

Part of the reason this is a classic example of data visualisation is because of how information 
dense the image is and how clearly it conveys different elements of the data. Let's try the same 
approach with a more recent figure.
