## Why visualisation?

Let's meet a dataset:


~~~
# A tibble: 142 x 3
   dataset     x     y
     <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
 1       4  55.4  97.2
 2       4  51.5  96.0
 3       4  46.2  94.5
 4       4  42.8  91.4
 5       4  40.8  88.3
 6       4  38.7  84.9
 7       4  35.6  79.9
 8       4  33.1  77.6
 9       4  29.0  74.5
10       4  26.2  71.4
# â€¦ with 132 more rows

Let's get an idea of its structure:

One little scatterplot:

Some more examples of why data visualisation is so valuable:

[The datasaur dozen](https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/samestats]. ) group of 12 two-dimensional datasets that have identical:

* mean in both dimensions
* sd in both dimensions
* correlation between x and y

**But...**

## The roles of data visualisation 

In general there are two purposes behind data visualisations:

* As a discovery tool, to explore a dataset
* As a storytelling tool, to highlight features of a dataset
In both cases, successful visualisation will 
illuminate and aid understanding, 
not confuse or obscure.
