## Why visualisation?

We have spent a lot of time learning about manipulating and exploring data. What sort of information
can we learn like that?

Let's meet some datasets:

```{r intro, echo=FALSE}
data
```

Get an idea of their overall structure:

```{r summary}
summary(data)
```

And some summary statistics for each dataset:

```{r summ_stats}
data %>% 
  group_by(dataset) %>% 
  summarise(
    mean_x = mean(x),
    mean_y = mean(y),
    sd_x = sd(x),
    sd_y = sd(y),
    correlation = cor(x,y)
  )
```

> ## Challenge 1
> What can we say about these datasets just from looking at their summaries?
{:.challenge}

Let's try plotting one of them to see if we can spot anything new:

```{r dino_scatter, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
ggplot(data_dino, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

And it immediately becomes apparent what all those numbers **mean**

The other data sets we looked at are known as [the datasaurus dozen](https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/samestats). A group of 12 two-dimensional datasets that have identical:

* mean in both dimensions
* sd in both dimensions
* correlation between x and y

**But...**

```{r scatter12, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
ggplot(data_12, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~dataset) +
  theme(aspect.ratio = 1)
```

## The roles of data visualisation 

In general there are two purposes behind data visualisations:

* As a discovery tool, to explore a dataset
* As a storytelling tool, to highlight features of a dataset

In both cases, a successful visualisation will illuminate and aid understanding, 
not confuse or obscure.

## Talking about visualisations

Our goal today will be to learn how to **describe** visualisations and their connections to data.
We will build up a consistent vocabulary around visualisations that can be used to describe and create
complex visualisations out of a series of simple tools.

The big concept of the day is any plot can be constructed by mapping variables in your **data** to 
visual properties (**aesthetics**) which are then applied to the physical marks (**geometries**) chosen
to represent the data

#### Process outline
![](../fig/grammar_simple.png)

> **Aesthetic:**
> 
> A visual property of the elements in a figure. Colour, size, and shape are all examples of

>
>
> **Geometry:**

> The physical representation of your data. Points, lines, and bars are examples of geometries

{:.callout}

This will probably be a very big change in how you think about figures, let's try it on a few examples.

Part of the reason this is a classic example of data visualisation is because of how information 
dense the image is and how clearly it conveys different elements of the data. Let's try the same 
approach with a more recent figure.

Working on a single figure at a time doesn't give a good idea of how *changes* to the aesthetics or
geometries can affect a figure. Changing either of these components can hide or reveal information, 
and can sometimes completely change the story your figure is telling.

Consider the following set:

#### Changing aesthetics 
```{r changing_aesthetics, echo = F, out.width="100%", warning=F, fig.height=4}
p <- ggplot(mtcars) + labs(x="weight", y="fuel efficiency (mpg)", colour="cylinders") + theme(legend.position = "bottom")

p1 <- p + geom_point(aes(x=wt, y = mpg, colour = factor(cyl)))

p2 <- p + geom_point(aes(x=wt, y = mpg, size = factor(cyl))) + labs(size = "cylinders")

p3 <- p + geom_point(aes(x=wt, y = cyl, colour = mpg)) + 
  labs(x="weight", y="cylinders", colour="fuel efficiency (mpg)") +
  scale_color_viridis_c()

p1 + p2 + p3
```

#### Changing geometries

```{r changing_geometries, echo = F, out.width="100%", warning=F, fig.height=4}
base_geom <- agridat::harris.wateruse %>% 
  group_by(species, day) %>% 
  summarise(mean_water_use = mean(water)) %>% 
  ungroup %>% 
  filter(day > 270) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=day, y = mean_water_use, fill = species, colour = species)) +
  labs(y = "mean water use") +
  scale_color_brewer(palette="Dark2") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="Dark2") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")

p1 <- base_geom + geom_col(position = "dodge")
p2 <- base_geom + geom_line()
p3 <- base_geom + geom_point()

p1 + p2 + p3
```

While the links between data, aesthetics, and geometries describe the core features of a visualisation,
there are several other components that influence the final figure.

Consider the following pair of plots:

```{r scales_intro, echo=FALSE,  out.width="100%", fig.height=4}
p1 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5)
p2 <- p1 +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_x_log10() + annotation_logticks()

p1 + p2
```

{: .challenge}

So this new concept extends our previous understanding of the visualisation process by affecting exactly
how values of your data are assigned to values of the visual property.

## Scale 

![](../fig/grammar_scales.png)

{:.callout}

To demonstrate that scaling is affecting the mapping of data to aesthetics, consider the following 
example:

```{r scales_v_data, echo=FALSE,  out.width="100%", fig.height=4}
p1 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) + labs(title = "Untransformed")
p2 <- ggplot(diamonds, aes(log10(carat), log10(price))) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) + labs(title = "Transformed data")
p3 <- p1 +
  scale_y_log10() +
  scale_x_log10() + annotation_logticks() + labs(title = "Transformed scale")

p1 + p2 + p3
```

In one of these, the *data* is transformed before plotting. In the other, the data values are left 
unchanged and just the *scaling* as to how those data points are mapped to the x and y axis is altered.

Do you find each option easier or harder to interpret?

Scales apply to all visual properties, with colour being the easiest to observe differences:

```{r colour_scale, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.height=4}
p <- mtcars %>% ggplot(aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + 
  labs(x="weight", y="fuel efficiency (mpg)", colour="cylinders") + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") 

p1 <- p + geom_point(aes(colour = cyl)) 
p2 <- p + geom_point(aes(colour = factor(cyl)))
p3 <- p + geom_point(aes(colour = factor(cyl))) + scale_color_brewer(palette="Dark2")

p1 + p2 + p3 + plot_annotation(tag_levels = "A")
```

In this example, the cylinder variable is mapped to three different colour scales. One continuous 
(**A**) in which the values of cylinder are mapped to a spectrum of dark to light blue. The other 
two are categorical (**B**, **C**) in which the unique values of cylinder are mapped to individual 
colour values. The specific colour values are determined by the scale and are different between the 
two plots.

The choice of scale for your visualisations will depend on your data. Are they continuous or 
categorical? Can they be mapped directly onto an appropriate scale, or would a transformed scale
better represent the data?


## Coordinates

As with scales controlling the conceptual mapping of data to a visual property, coordinates control 
the physical mapping of geometries to positions on a screen/page.

![](../fig/grammar_coord.png)

> ## New term
> **Coordinate system:**
> 
> Controls how the points, lines, bars etc. of a visualisation get placed in physical space. 
{:.callout}

The coordinate system you are most familiar with is the Cartesian coordinate system. This is the x/y
two dimensional plane that has been used in the examples so far. 

A simple modification we could make to this system is to enforce a condition on the coordinates that
our two dimensions have to be equal. In other words, a unit of length along the x axis is the same 
physical distance as a unit of length along the y axis:

```{r coord_fixed, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.height=4}
p <- tibble(x = seq(-80,80, 10), y = seq(-80,80, 10)) %>% 
  expand(x,y) %>% 
  filter(x>=-50, x <= 50) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x,y, colour = y)) + 
  geom_point() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

p2 <- p + coord_fixed()

p + p2
```

In this example, you can see that on the right hand figure, the distance between -50 and 0 on the x axis
is exactly the sasme distance as between -50 and 0 on the y axis.

> ## Discussion
> Why might you choose to enforce this restriction on the coordinate system?
{: .discussion}

While this might seem like a small change, changing the coordinate system can have a drastic effect
on the presentation of your data and how it is interpreted.

```{r coord_more, echo = FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.height=4}
p3 <- p + coord_polar() + labs(title = "Polar coordinates")

p4 <- p + coord_map(projection = "gilbert") + labs(title = "Map projection")

p3 + p4
```

> ## Discussion
> The two plots above show exactly the same data as the grid previously. Do the changed coordinates
> change how you might interpret the data?
{: .discussion}

## Applying your visualisation vocabulary

By now you have developed a vocabulary that will let you talk consistently about figures. Time to try
it out on something you are familiar with.

{: .challenge}

This process allows you to decsribe a figure even if you are not familiar with how to create it.

## That special something
Until now, everything we have discussed has had some *functional* role in creating a figure. We have 
been talking about how to display our data with a visual representation that allows us to understand
the features of our data. There are a lot of other aspects to a plot that can affect the final look 
however.

> ## Challenge
> What changes between the following plots? What term would *you* use to describe these features?
> 
> ```{r themes, echo = FALSE, out.width="70%", fig.height=6}
> p1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, colour = factor(cyl))) + geom_point() + labs(title = "Example plot") + theme(legend.position = "none")
> 
> p2 <- p1 + theme_wsj() + scale_colour_wsj() + theme(legend.position = "none")
> p3 <- p1 + theme_fivethirtyeight() + scale_colour_fivethirtyeight() + theme(legend.position = "none")
> p4 <- p1 + theme_economist() + scale_colour_economist() + theme(legend.position = "none")
> 
> p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 + plot_layout(nrow=2)
> ```
{:.challenge}

These aspects to not change the data elements of a figure, but do have an impact on how the plot looks.
We will refer to these as the **theme** of a visualisation.
